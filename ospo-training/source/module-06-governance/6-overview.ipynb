    "# Module 6: Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources\n",
    "* John Metric. [_Open Source Projects - Beyond Code_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/open-source-projects/9781837636884/). O`Reilly Media, 2023.  Metric is the current director of program management for The Linux Foundation.\n",
    "* Dave Neary, Josh Berkus, Katrina Novakovic, Bryan Behranshausen.  [\"Understanding open source governance models\"](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models), Red Hat Blog, 2020.  Authors are from Red Hat's Open Source Programming Office.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is open source governance?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Governance* describes the decision-making that an open source projects need to function. This is how policies and processes are defined.  Some examples of policies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Roles and responsibilities**\n",
    "  - Who gets to do what?\n",
    "* **Accepting code**\n",
    "  - What are the policies to ensure code stability and quality?\n",
    "  - What are the policies to ensure supply-chain security?\n",
    "* **Releasing code?**\n",
    "  - What are the criteria for a stable release?\n",
    "  - What is the release cadence?\n",
    "* **Getting new contributors involved**\n",
    "  - Is the contributor qualified?\n",
    "  - Is the contributor trusted?\n",
    "* **Communication**\n",
    "  - How do users report bugs and feature requests?\n",
    "  - Who can speak on behalf of the project?\n",
    "  - How are interpersonal disputes resolved?\n",
    " \n",
    "There is no one-size-fits-all solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models of Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of governance differ primarily on:\n",
    "* Who gets to make decisions\n",
    "* How decisions get made\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cathedral vs. Bazaar\n",
    "\n",
    "An older model, first described in Linux community around 1999.  Describes both **governance** (who gets to make decisions) and **contribution** (who gets to add new code).\n",
    "\n",
    "![chapel_and_bazaar](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/img/governancevcontrib.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two extremes of **governance**:\n",
    "  - Benevolent Dictator: Single individual or organization makes policy decisions\n",
    "  - Meritocracy: Ability to make decisions is given to significant contributors\n",
    "* Two extremes of **contribution**:\n",
    "  - Bazaar: Project accepts code from many external developers\n",
    "  - Cathedral: Project has a group of core developers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Five Recent Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Many recent OSS advocates describe 5 models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do-ocracy (a.k.a Meritocracy)\n",
    "2. Founder-leader (a.k.a, Benevolent Dictator for Life, )\n",
    "3. Self-appointed technical council\n",
    "4. Electoral\n",
    "5. Vendor-backed\n",
    "6. Foundation-backed\n",
    "\n",
    "Not mutually-exclusive.  Within one project, different policies may be decided through different models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Do-ocracy\n",
    "\n",
    "* The people doing the work are the ones making decisions\n",
    "  - Often no formal governance.  Just implicit governance in group's interactions\n",
    "  - Usually still have contribution guidelines (peer review of code, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apache Web Server: https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "* Easy for small teams with few stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* Decision-making usually does not scale with more contributors and stakeholders\n",
    "* Can be difficult for newcomers to integrate with the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Founder-leader (BDFL)\n",
    "\n",
    "* One person who started the project is the ultimate decision-maker\n",
    "* Leader determines projects priorities and vision, settles disputes among other\n",
    "    contributors, and decides which contributions are merged\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Linux and Linus Torvalds\n",
    "* Python and Guido van Rossum : a BDFL early-on, and van Rossum is still \"honorary\" BDFL.\n",
    "  But now has foundation-backed governance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "* Easy for small teams with few stakeholders\n",
    "* Common for most projects to start this way\n",
    "* A humble, inclusive, constructive leader can set a positive tone\n",
    "    for how community can function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* Does not scale with more contributors and stakeholders\n",
    "  - Problems with patches getting dropped were a frequent complaint in Linux until\n",
    "    Torvalds distributed responsibilities more [see examples in mailing list archives](https://lwn.net/2002/0131/a/patch-penguin.php3)\n",
    "  - A BDFL may not-be-so-benevolent.  Contributors who have disputes with founder do not have other\n",
    "    recourse, and projects can get forked.\n",
    "  - Founders' personal views may affect public perception of project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Self-appointed technical council\n",
    "\n",
    "- A small group determine's project priorities, decides which\n",
    "  contributions will be merged, ...\n",
    "- The council also decides who will be added to the council\n",
    "- A midpoint between Meritocracy and Founder-leader model\n",
    "- Many names for group: technical council, steering committee, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Apache Software Foundation: https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/\n",
    "  - Several councils with different roles/responsibilities.  Mostly business, stakeholder relations, etc.\n",
    "  - Individual software projects are meritocratic\n",
    "* OpenAPI: https://www.openapis.org/participate/how-to-contribute/governance\n",
    "  - A open standard, not an actual piece of software\n",
    "  - Several councils with different roles/responsibilities: Technical Steering Committee,\n",
    "    Technical Oversight Committee, Business Governance Board\n",
    "* Councils are quite common with open standards\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scales better for larger projects with many stakeholders\n",
    "* Decision-making is efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Member selection process may exclusionary\n",
    "* May create self-reinforcing leadership structure\n",
    "* May create disconnect between leadership and community\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Electoral\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Single-vendor Backed\n",
    "\n",
    "A company may decide to open source a project for a variety of reasons\n",
    "- Releasing open source code that seems useful to the community\n",
    "- Providing an early version of a product to gauge user interest and engagement. \n",
    "  * E.g., Kubernetes was released by Google and user interest led to the creation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation\n",
    "- Creating a \"freemium\" version of a product\n",
    "\n",
    "Community contributions are welcomed but the vision for the project is typically controlled by one stakeholder\n",
    "- Over time, governance may shift to another model as community engagement grows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/community/\n",
    "- Android\n",
    "- MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard to find docs re: governance...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "- Similar to Founder-Leader but with a larger amount of resources behind development\n",
    "- Quality of open source code benefits from professional software engineer support\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "- Similar to Founder-Leader, a company's vision for a project may differ from that of the community\n",
    "- Lack of investment from the vendor can cause the project to stagnate and lose community involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Foundation-backed\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-source projects often hit a glass ceiling, with many of the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It’s not clear how a project is funded or how it operates, or there is a perception that it primarily benefits a single vendor\n",
    "* There isn’t a neutral owner of assets, such as the project name, logo, domain names, social accounts, and other assets\n",
    "* The copyright holder of the project is a single entity, giving them unilateral control to change the license and intellectual property policies without the community’s input\n",
    "* Vendors leveraging the technology don’t feel they have a space to fairly collaborate, especially if they are competitors\n",
    "* The legal, fiduciary, and financial aspects of the project are managed by one organization without transparency or given processes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python Language Foundation:  https://www.python.org/psf/about/\n",
    "* Rust Foundation:  https://foundation.rust-lang.org/about/\n",
    "* PHP Foundation:  https://thephp.foundation/foundation/\n",
    "* Ruby Central:  https://thephp.foundation/foundation/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* Solves the above-mentioned issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* It's a lot of work to form a legal entity\n",
    "  - Funding: The bove-mentioned projects are non-profit entities backed by donations and/or corporate sponsorship\n",
    "  - Staffing: Usually need committed staff to operate\n",
    "* Solution: Can integrate your project in an umbrella council or foundation\n",
    "  - Apache Software Foundation\n",
    "  - Linux Foundation\n"
