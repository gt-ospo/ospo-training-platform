    "# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson you should understand what CI/CD is and a simple example of how it can be applied to your own codebase. In this lesson you will learn about the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What CI/CD does and how automation of testing assists with maintaining code quality across large projects.\n",
    "* How GitHub actions can be used to implement CI/CD workflows\n",
    "* How CI/CD tests can be run on multiple backends in parallel with matrix builds\n",
    "* Examples of CI/CD in action with a small test project as well as production-grade CI/CD workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Training Video\n",
    "\n",
    "Video link will be posted after the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is CI/CD important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI/CD) refers to an automation strategy for testing code within a codebase and then integrating the tested code into a product ready for use in a production environment. The primary benefit of CI/CD is that it allows for quick evaluation, integration, and deployment of a collaborative code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Integration** - refers to the automated process of testing and integrating new code. Typically with a GitHub based flow, code is tested from branches or remote forks and then integrated into the main code branch when it passes tests and code review. Packaging of the code into an executable format can also be part of the integration process.  \n",
    "* **Continuous Delivery** - tested and approved code changes are staged and then pushed to the production environment.   \n",
    "* **Continuous Deployment** - refers to a process where production-ready code is automatically deployed after extensive automated testing. This is less common and mostly used for very mature codebases with high code coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ci-cd-pipeline](https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/img/lesson-04/git-ci-cd.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure shows the typical workflow for a CI/CD pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read more in depth discussion about CI/CD via [GitHub's overview](https://resources.github.com/devops/ci-cd/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## CI/CD Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This training focuses on the use of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), but there are several other popular CI/CD frameworks that you might encounter for the automation of code testing and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other CI Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different CI/CD frameworks that you could use. Other common frameworks for CI/CD that you might encounter include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - self-contained, open source, and Java based; typically used for on-premise deployments.\n",
    "- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).\n",
    "- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) - open source, Apache licensed Java Project Object Model framework.\n",
    "- [Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/architectures/devops-pipelines-baseline-architecture?view=azure-devops) - Microsofts DevOps framework that ties in with other MS Azure infrastructure\n",
    "- [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - integrated with Gitlab cloud instances and self-hosted Gitlab installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common CI/CD formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Many CI/CD frameworks use a common configuration format to specify the steps of a particular CI/CD workflow, typically YAML.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* To learn more about how GitHub Actions uses YAML see this [blog post](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).  \n",
    "* For a quick reference on how to specify certain parameters in YAML, see this [Learn YAML in X Minutes page](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).\n",
    "  \n",
    "A simple YAML example for a GitHub Action that triggers on a `push` operation to the main branch might look as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches:\n",
    "      - main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to invoke an Action on every push to any branch, or specify multiple triggers at once:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "on: [push, pull_request]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Investigating GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we should define some common terminology for the [components of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitHub Actions** - the CI/CD infrastructure that supports build, test, and deploymen automation\n",
    "- **Action** - A piece of code that supports a common and repeatable task via the GH Actions framework. Typically Docker, Javascript, or composite and can be published as a GitHub App.\n",
    "- **Workflow** - An automated process that contains 1 or more jobs, usually written in a YAML file.\n",
    "- **Runner** - A server that executes a single job from a workflow. GitHub hosted runners include Linux, Windows, and MacOS, or you can also set up [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).\n",
    "- **Job** - A job is a set of steps that either runs a shell script or executes an action. Job steps are executed sequentially but separate jobs can be run in parallel using separate runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are typically specified in the top-level directory `.github/workflows`. We will incrementally improve a `test` YAML file from our [sample repo](https://github.com/gt-ospo/testing_ci_cd/) to investigate the pieces of a typical workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along with this training, please fork the [testing-with-ci-cd repo](https://github.com/gt-ospo/testing-with-ci-cd) so you can modify the .yml files and check the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Testing Workflow (V1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of our workflow, [test-v1.yml](https://github.com/gt-ospo/testing-with-ci-cd/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-v1.yml) shows a very basic Python-oriented workflow. Note that the job is named `test-v1`, it uses a GitHub supported runner based on an Ubuntu VM, and it executes several actions and steps to install a specific version of Python.\n",

    "# Useful GitHub Actions Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activating and Deactivating Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "As we add more workflows, we may want to [enable or disable a specific workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow). We might do this to save time or resources or just because we need to debug one specific workflow within the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we see in the figure here, we can deactivate our older versions of the test workflow and just use the newest version, V3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/img/lesson-04/ci-cd-disable-workflow.jpg?raw=1)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have implemented automated testing for your codebase, you can then move on to the \"delivery\" part of CI/CD, which involves deploying your code either as an executable, tarball, or package for download or as part of a larger production environment. For our codebase, we would like to deploy a new Python package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [deploy.yml](https://github.com/jyoung3131/testing-with-ci-cd/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow file uses the `gh-action-pypi-publish` [action](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish) to push our package to PyPI, but we need to examine two more advanced topics before looking at the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage of Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) can be used to store sensitive data like keys or passwords that need to be used by a GitHub workflow. Secrets are specified at the repository level, and they can be shared with reviewers without revealing the sensitive data inside the secret.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Concurrency with GitHub Action Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "Jobs can typically run in parallel, but we might not want a deployment to run multiple, concurrent jobs especially if it is generating output artifacts. The `concurrency` keyword can be used with groups to limit the amount of parallelism for a particular job. In our deploy.yml, this looks as follows:  \n",
